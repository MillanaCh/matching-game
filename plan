1) create const URl and KEY outside func

2) create const fetching with await (fetch or async await)
  * do not forget try and catch
  * make fetch(URL+KEY) 
       * but we need 12 photo and double this request with page2 and page 3 to get 20
  * convert to json()
  * check console.log(data)
3) install axios (instead fetch) npm install axios
and replace try, we do not need json with axios 
   * destructoring with axios.all() to put all in one
   * make copy with ... and slice, because splice is cutting (removing)
4)we need unique key for every with another library nanoid npm install and pass before set with map
   * map data and return with copy of image and new element: unique: with nanoid()
5) make App part with map to map photos, create div for each photo  and img-use thumb size of img, (key, src, alt)
  * add css part
6) make randomness to photos after try before mapping=>
  * create func expression and param(data)
    * make random 
    * store the rndom number in variable
    * replace 0 index to index of random number
    * instead 0 index make random number
  * replace data with random function
  * set to hook new one
7) we need onClick in div we make func onClick and make if station 
  * make copy
  * set new key check if we clicked
  * set copy to setPhotos
8) new state [ ] for track 
  * if (statement - save index to new state) 
    if is null set index and stop function (check if i have selected in last click), if do not have will add index there to compare in future
    else  
       * (if the player clicked the same image) if unique is same stop function
       * (else if was another clicked) 
       if index id and selected id is not equal
       setTimeout(
         change our key again to false
         set change to null
         set to newPhoto
       )
       else (set to null)
 9)
